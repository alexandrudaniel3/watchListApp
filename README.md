# WatchBucket for Android and iOS

A cross-platform watch list app built using React Native. Search for movies and TV shows, save them to your list and
share them with your friends.

## Key Features:

- Save movies and TV series to your watch list. When you're done with them, mark them as watched to keep them organized.
- Read information about the title you're looking for. Check reviews, descriptions, trailers, and share the title with your friends to spread the fun!
- Thanks to the Open Movie Database, you can find almost every title imaginable.
